The aim is to understand the key terminologies of TCP and UDP and to understand the key differences between them. This paper lists out the functions and basic operation of both protocols (TCP and UDP) and finally a comparison between the two protocols is presented. In, addition, this paper provides a brief survey on the performance of TCP over wireless networks.},
